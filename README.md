This site includes a simple JavaScript code as a logic of convertation to different number systems: binary, decimal, hexidecimal. First the program gets the user input. Then after the buttons to convert are being pressed, the program checks if the input is valid. Next, if its valid it converts the number to the chosen number system and print it out; else it prints out the the information about invalid input. 
In addition, I added custom cursors and a Kirby gif for fun ^^
